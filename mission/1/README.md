## First episode
- you get a sim card
- from there you get a call log
- sort it in order of freq
    - Mom
    - Wife
    - Contact
    - a bunch of less frequent ones
- from the address associated with the phone number, get an interview
- if you get the righ interview, it will reveal something fun

## Second episode
- if you provide evidence (code), you are given lat/log coordinates on where the cell phone call took place
- you trace the cell phone path
- given lat/long coordinates, share all of the addresses that are close by
- one of the places has a dataset (shipment logs - has a destination)
- then you go to that address (after the warrant) and it is a confectionary shop

## Third episode
- k9 dogs found nothing
- we get a dataset of logs/ledgers and current inventory
- we cross-compare them with join
    - discrepancy, there is an item that does not occur in the inventory
- you get the address of the kinder eggs destination but they are gone already, the place was recently abandoned
- you do find a clue that will be used in the next assignment

### Data mechanics
The data inputs for this are
1) text records
2) shipping logs
3) gps coordinates
4) interviews
5) public datasets and a way to turn addresses into coordinates and vice-versa
