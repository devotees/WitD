# Where in the Data is Carmen San Mateo?

You were pursuing a suspect down Remark road.
They turn on a sharp corner, and you notice that they have dropped their phone.

You knelt to pick up the phone.
If it was intended to be a diversion, it has succeeded; the suspect has vanished.


The phone is locked, and the password is regrettably not '123456'.
You take out the SIM card, and note the IMEI number, which is 90283489102482.
From this, you can use your connections to get the call logs from the phone company.

Start by going to the [clue answer portal](/clues) and requesting the call logs.
One of their recent or regular contacts should be someone we can question.
